test_def $0 "whitespace parser"
# the "word" parser unfortunatly treats everything except
# a SP as being in the word. So a HT inside a word is
# permitted, which does not work well with what we
# want to test here. to solve this problem, we use op-quoted-string.
# However, we must actually quote the samples with HT, because
# that parser also treats HT as being part of the word. But thanks
# to the quotes, we can force it to not do that.
