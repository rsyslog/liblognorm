/**
 * @file liblognorm.h
 * @brief The public liblognorm API.
 *
 * <b>Functions other than those defined here MUST not be called by
 * a liblognorm "user" application.</b>
 *
 * This file is meant to be included by applications using liblognorm.
 * For lognorm library files themselves, include "lognorm.h".
 *//**
 * @mainpage
 * Liblognorm is an easy to use and fast samples-based log normalization
 * library.
 *
 * It can be passed a stream of arbitrary log messages, one at a time, and for
 * each message it will output well-defined name-value pairs and a set of
 * tags describing the message.
 *
 * For further details, see it's initial announcement available at
 *    https://rainer.gerhards.net/2010/10/introducing-liblognorm.html
 *
 * The public interface of this library is describe in liblognorm.h.
 *
 * Liblognorm fully supports Unicode. Like most Linux tools, it operates
 * on UTF-8 natively, called "passive mode". This was decided because we
 * so can keep the size of data structures small while still supporting
 * all of the world's languages (actually more than when we did UCS-2).
 *
 * At the  technical level, we can handle UTF-8 multibyte sequences transparently.
 * Liblognorm needs to look at a few US-ASCII characters to do the
 * sample base parsing (things to indicate fields), so this is no
 * issue. Inside the parse tree, a multibyte sequence can simple be processed
 * as if it were a sequence of different characters that make up a their
 * own symbol each. In fact, this even allows for somewhat greater parsing
 * speed.

 *
 * It does so by emitting "interesting" information about its processing
 * at various stages. A caller can obtain this information by registering
 * an entry point. When done so, liblognorm will call the entry point
 * whenever it has something to emit. Note that debugging can be rather
 * verbose.
 *
 * The callback will be called with the following three parameters in that order:
 * - the caller-provided cookie
 * - a zero-terminated string buffer
 * - the length of the string buffer, without the trailing NUL byte
 *
 * @note
 * The provided callback function <b>must not</b> call any liblognorm
 * APIs except when specifically flagged as safe for calling by a debug
 * callback handler.
 *
 * @param[in] ctx The library context to apply callback to.
 * @param[in] cb The function to be called for debugging
 * @param[in] cookie Opaque cookie to be passed down to debug handler. Can be
 *                   used for some state tracking by the caller. This is defined as
 *                   void* to support pointers. To play it safe, a pointer should be
