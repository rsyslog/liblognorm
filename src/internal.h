 * @brief Internal things just needed for building the library, but
 * not to be installed.

 * @mainpage
 * Liblognorm is an easy to use and fast samples-based log normalization
 * library.
 *
 * It can be passed a stream of arbitrary log messages, one at a time, and for
 * each message it will output well-defined name-value pairs and a set of
 * tags describing the message.
 *
 * For further details, see it's initial announcement available at
 *    https://rainer.gerhards.net/2010/10/introducing-liblognorm.html
 *
 * The public interface of this library is describe in liblognorm.h.
 *
 * Liblognorm fully supports Unicode. Like most Linux tools, it operates
 * on UTF-8 natively, called "passive mode". This was decided because we
 * so can keep the size of data structures small while still supporting
 * all of the world's languages (actually more than when we did UCS-2).
 *
 * At the  technical level, we can handle UTF-8 multibyte sequences transparently.
 * Liblognorm needs to look at a few US-ASCII characters to do the
 * sample base parsing (things to indicate fields), so this is no
 * issue. Inside the parse tree, a multibyte sequence can simple be processed
 * as if it were a sequence of different characters that make up a their
 * own symbol each. In fact, this even allows for somewhat greater parsing
 * speed.
