Version 1.1.3, 2016-03-07
- add support for libfastjson
- make work on Solaris
- check for runaway rules.
  A runaway rule is one that has unmatched percent signs and thus
  is not terminated properly at its end. This also means we no longer
  accept "rule=" at the first column of a continuation line, which is
  no problem (see doc for more information).
- fix: process last line if it misses the terminating LF
  This problem occurs with the very last line of a rulebase (at EOF).
  If it is not properly terminated (LF missing), it is silently ignored.
  Previous versions did obviously process lines in this case. While
  technically this is invalid input, we can't outrule that such rulebases
  exist. For example, they do in the rsyslog testbench, which made
  us aware of the problem (see https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/489 )
  I think the proper way of addressing this is to process such lines without
  termination, as many other tools do as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.2, 2015-07-20
- permit newline inside parser definition
- new parser "cisco-interface-spec"
- new parser "json" to process json parts of the message
- new parser "mac48" to process mac layer addresses
- new parser "name-value-list" (currently inofficial, experimental)
- some parsers did incorrectly report success when an error occurred
  this was caused by inconsistencies between various macros. We have
  changed the parser-generation macros to match the semantics of the
  broader CHKN/CHKR macros and also restructured/simplified the 
  parser generation macros.
  closes https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm/issues/41
- call "rest" parser only if nothing else matches.
  Versions prior to 1.1.2 did execute "rest" during regular parser
  processing, and thus parser matches have been more or less random.
  With 1.1.2 this is now always the last parser called. This may cause
  problems with existing rulesets, HOWEVER, adding any other rule or
  changing the load order would also have caused problems, so there
  really is no compatibility to preserve.

- new API to support error callbacks 
  This permits callers to forward messages in regard to e.g. wrong rule
  bases to their users, which is very useful and actually missing in the
  previous code base. So far, we only have few error messages.
  However, we will review the code and add more. The important part is
  that callers can begin to use the new API and thus will benefit when
  we add more error messages.
- testbench is now enabled by default
- bugfix: misadressing on some constant values
  see also https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm/pull/67
  Thanks to github user ontholerian for the patch
- bugfix: add missing function prototypes
  This could potentially lead to problems on some platforms,
  especially those with 64 bit pointers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.1, 2015-03-09
- fixed library version numbering
  Thanks to Tomas Heinreich for reporting the problem.
- added new parser syntaxes
  Thanks to Janmejay Singh for implementing most of them.
- bugfix: function ln_parseFieldDescr() returns state value
  due to unitialized variable. This can also lead to invalid
  returning no sample node where one would have to be created.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.0, 2015-01-08
- added regular expression support
  use this feature with great care, as it thrashes performance
  Thanks to Janmejay Singh for implementing this feature.
- fix build problem when --enable-debug was set
  closes: https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm/issues/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1, 2014-04-11
- improved doc (via RST/Sphinx)
- bugfix: unparsed fields were copied incorrectly from non-terminated
  string. Thanks to Josh Blum for the fix.
- bugfix: mandatory tag did not work in lognormalizer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0, 2013-11-28
- WARNING: this version has incompatible interface and older programs 
  will not compile with it.
  For details see http://www.liblognorm.com/news/on-liblognorm-1-0-0/
- libestr is not used any more in interface functions. Traditional
  C strings are used instead. Internally, libestr is still used, but
  scheduled for removal.
- libee is not used any more. JSON-C is used for object handling
  instead. Parsers and formatters are now part of liblognorm.
- added new field type "rest", which simply sinks all up to end of
  the string.
- added support for glueing two fields together, without literal 
  between them. It allows for constructs like:
  %volume:number%%unit:word%
  which matches string "1000Kbps"
- Fix incorrect merging of trees with empty literal at end
  Thanks to Pavel Levshin for the patch
- this version has survived many bugfixes

  Thanks to the Fedora folks for pointing this out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.4 (rgerhards), 2012-04-16

Version 0.3.2 (rgerhards), 2011-11-21

  but no field is written
- special handling for iptables log via %iptables% parser added 
  (currently experimental pending practical verification)
- normalizer tool on its way to a full-blow stand-alone tool
- support for annotations added, for the time being see

  fields parsed out (uncommon scenario)

  not deleted

  message generation

  been allocated
